# Password_Generator
>This project showcases the using of Javascript to create a password generator. When the button is clicked, the user is prompted to input the desired password length. If it is between the the outlined parameters, the user is then asked further which character types-- numbers,special,upper case, and lower case-- they would like in their password. The password will then appear in the text box.

> Honestly, it was a tough project because there are many ways to go about doing this. But overall, I gained a better understanding of the use of functions,objects,loops,and logic.
